            Hi! My name is Kervin, and I welcome you to this portfolio site I just created a minute before you read this. I can read through your mind. Want me to prove it? Think of a number that is after the number 5. And yes, I know that you have the number 6 in mind. That's how great my mind-reading skills are.
